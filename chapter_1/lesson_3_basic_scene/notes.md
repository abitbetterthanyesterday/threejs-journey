# Scene
Where eveything will be happening ... the scene!

# Mesh
A triangular based object. A combination of a geometry and a material

# Camera
A simple POV
Different kind of camera

The first parameter is the field of view, which is vertical (how many degrees).

The second is the aspect ratio.

# Renderer
Render of the scene, as seen from the camera, onto the canvas.


**Important note**
By default, you can only see one side of the triangle (the outside). So if the camera is inside the object, you can't see it
